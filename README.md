# _Individual Project Design Brief / Project Specifications_

_State the purpose of your application clearly and concisely. Try to do it in a single sentence._

"Tinder for Roommates"

_Answer the following questions as you did in your Group Project:_
_- What is the problem you are trying to solve?_
_- Who is your target audience?_
_- What are your specific goals?_

Amsterdam is a very difficult city to live in, and one of the biggest struggles that everyone faces when they move here is finding somewhere to live.

The demand for housing in Amsterdam is much greater than the supply, and as the city is already so small and so densely populated, this has created massive competition for housing, which is getting more and more expensive.

When you first arrive in a new city, it can be incredibly intimidating, as there is so much to do (setting up a bank account, finding a job, getting a BSN appointment), and finding somewhere to live can often be the most stressful part,

I am still part of several Facebook groups for finding a room in Amsterdam, and these groups are either people advertising themselves to say that they are looking for somewhere to live, people who are advertising a room and are looking for someone to move in, or people who have (almost) been the victim of a scam which is often a falsely advertised room and are warning other users what to look out for.

Often people who move here will be on a tight budget of what they can afford so this can limit the options of what they can look for, and may force someone to take a very small room where they are not even allowed to make use of parts of the apartment (see link).

The idea of my application is that people who are moving to / have just moved to Amsterdam can create an account, make a profile for themselves and can view the profiles of other users who might be a suitable match for them to look for somewhere to live together. This is a very useful way to meet other people who will also hopefully match your personality and lifestyle.

What I would like to do is offer a platform where people who are trying to find a room in Amsterdam, can first find a potential roommate in Amsterdam. This way, they can share knowledge, funding and can search together. This can be particularly beneficial if one person is unable to go to a viewing due to other commitments.  It can be very difficult, risky and time consuming to search for somewhere to live on your own, and that is why you should use my application.

The specific goals of this application are as follows:

1. Match up people who are trying to find somewhere to live in Amsterdam
2. Meet new people
3. Increase the number of of possibilities for housing which would not have been affordable alone
4. Ultimately make it easier and less risky for people to find somewhere to live in Amsterdam

_In another block, answer the following:_
_- What is your business model?_ _-Where is your revenue coming from?_
_- What are the costs of your business?_

The concept of this business will be that users are likely to be active members for a short time as once they find a place to live they will have no immediate need for the application again. This is a different business model as it will not be dependent on repeat business from the same customers, but we hope that through positive experiences and word of mouth recommendations that the application will be used by new people moving to Amsterdam.

Therefore it will be vital to have a strong online presence through online marketing on social media such as Facebook and Twitter.

It is also unrealistic to expect to charge people for use of the application, and it is unlikely that they will pay for a monthly subscription. Therefore revenue will have to come from different sources, primarily from advertising. We will offer advertising space to businesses which are likely to be used by people who are living here for the first time (such as IKEA)

Another idea is that this can also be a blog feature "Things I wish I had of known before I moved to Amsterdam" which can provide essential information for people who are thinking about living here. We would hope that people who use the app will contribute to the blog to help future users.

The costs of the business will include:

### Full Stack Developers
- The website will need to be very user friendly and presentable, but it is important that all of the information is being stored and processed correctly in the back end. If we wish to try new features and ideas in the future then these developers will be essential in order to implement them. The developers will also be responsible for website maintenance, in order to make sure that the site is functional.

### Advertising
- For the launch of the product it will be critical to ensure that people are made aware of its existence. This can be achieved through the use of social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc.

### Market research:
- Who is your current competition?

Currently, the idea is highly disorganized on Facebook. I have seen post on some groups, such as "Find a room in Amsterdam", where people will ask if anyone is looking for a room, and perhaps they should look together.

Rooms are advertised on Facebook, Craigslist, Kamernet etc. and I have seen many people posting to Facebook with information such as:

- Country of origin
- Occupation / study pathway
- Personality type
- Budget

This web application will let you browse profiles of people who are also searching for a room, but will also make suggestions based on the sorting algorithm of who might be an ideal housemate for you. If you see someone who you think would be a good housemate then it will be possible to contact them and exchange contact information.

_- How is your product different from currently available competitors?_
_- What is the current supply / demand for your product?_

There is a website based in the US called Rommies, (https://www.roomies.com/find-place) and this lets users find a room mate to be paired up with and is also a place for advertising rooms.

This application is different in that it is targeted on a single city, and is not about turning a huge profit, but rather it exists to provide a service to help prevent the exploitation of people who have just moved to Amsterdam.

I believe that there is a huge demand for this kind of service, as finding somewhere to live in Amsterdam can be a huge challenge.

Have a timeline of milestones to reach, including deadlines:
- Create milestones that represent the discrete blocks of functionality.
- Give an estimate for how long each will take per engineer.
- Determine whether things can be built concurrently.
- Come up with a timeline of goals to stick to.
